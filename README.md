# SHP---DFT-on-Alkali-Metals
Code base for my Senior Honours Project which involves using DFT to test for supercondictivity in alkali metals

Resources:
The DFT code was taken from Quantum Espresso (https://gitlab.com/QEF/q-e/-/releases) with help and tutorials from here: https://pranabdas.github.io/espresso/ 

Aims:
This project aims to replicate the experimental result of Lithium undergoing a phase transition into a superconductor at 15K and 30 GPa (insert Citation) using Density Functional Theory (DFT). The techniques learned will then be applied to other alkali metals to see if they are likely to become superconductors under similar conditions. 

Scientific Motivation:
Analysing the conditions that superconductors can occur in may lead to a prediction on how certain materials become superconducter. This prediction may then allow for high temperature superconductors to be created and utilised in everyday life. Testing materials under extreme conditions and solving the Shrodinger Equation of many body systems can be near impossible, so using computational methods such as DFT can give a good inclination into what may be the outcome without needing to perform many experiments

Personal Motivation: 
As a Computational Physics (MPhys, University of Edinburgh) with a keen interest in Condensed Matter Physics, this project allowed me to develop a deep understanding of DFT and how it is applied in research. I was also given the chance to apply concepts I had learned about in courses on condensed matter (phonons) and quantum mechanics (pauli exclusion principle, Hartree-Fock) to develop a deeper understanding of superconductors, their different types and the mechanisms that occur to allow materials to become superconductive. Finally, I was able to develop my programming skills and learned some C++ after having only used Python before.

This project was supervised by Dr Miguel Martinez-Canales of the University of Edinburgh so special thanks go to his guidance throughout.
