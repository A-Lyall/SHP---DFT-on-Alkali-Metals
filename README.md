# SHP---DFT-on-Alkali-Metals
Code base for my Senior Honours Project which involves using DFT to test for supercondictivity in alkali metals

Resources:
The DFT code was taken from Quantum Espresso (https://gitlab.com/QEF/q-e/-/releases) with help and tutorials from here: https://pranabdas.github.io/espresso/ 

Aims:
This project aims to replicate the experimental result of Lithium undergoing a phase transition into a superconductor at 15K and 30 GPa (insert Citation) using Density Functional Theory (DFT). The techniques learned will then be applied to other alkali metals to see if they are likely to become superconductors under similar conditions.

This project was supervised by Dr Miguel Martinez-Canales of the University of Edinburgh so special thanks go to his guidance throughout.
