# SHP---DFT-on-Alkali-Metals
Code base for my Senior Honours Project which involves using DFT to test for supercondictivity in alkali metals


The DFT code was taken from Quantum Espresso (https://gitlab.com/QEF/q-e/-/releases) with help and tutorials from here: https://pranabdas.github.io/espresso/
